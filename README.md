# phyton-project
This project is a Python-based utility that formats and arranges arithmetic problems (addition and subtraction) vertically for better readability. It is designed to meet the requirements of the FreeCodeCamp Scientific Computing with Python course. The program also includes an optional feature to display solutions alongside the formatted problems.
